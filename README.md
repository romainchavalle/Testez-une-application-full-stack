# Yoga app

This project contains an Angular Frontend (Angular 14) and a SpringBoot Backend (Java 1.8, SpringBoot 2.6.1)
You will need Java 11 (or later), NodeJS 16, MySQL and Angular CLI 14 on your machine.

## How to install

Git clone :

git clone romainchavalle/Testez-une-application-full-stack

1) FRONT

Then to run the front, go to {path to the root}/front and run :

npm install
npm run start

2) BACK

Database installation :
If you don't have MySQL in your machine, here is the installation doc : https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/installing.html
Database connection :

Open a terminal, and use this command :
mysql -u {yourUsername} -p
Then you have to enter your password, and should be successfully connected tu MySQL DB.
CREATE DATABASE test;
USE test;
SOURCE /path/to/project/resources/sql/file.sql

Now, Database is successfully imported.
In the backend's application.properties, you have to add the property spring.datasource.password={yourPassword} (or add this variable in your environment variables)
You may have to change spring.datasource.username property to fit your MySQL username.

Then to run the back, go to {path to the root}/back and run :
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
